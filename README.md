For more information about the C(anonical) Scan Matcher, see the webpage: http://purl.org/censi/2007/csm .

This is the "master" branch of CSM, which uses GSL.

There is also another branch, called [``csm_eigen``][branch], which uses the ``eigen`` library. 
This branch is the work of people working at U. Freiburg and Kuka, including
Christoph Sprunk and Rainer Kuemmerle.
